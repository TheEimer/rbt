# ARLBench Examples

We provide three different categories of examples:
1. Examples for black-box hyperparameter tuning using the 'hypersweeper' package. 
2. Running a schedule based on a reward heuristic
3. Running a reactive schedule based on the gradient history

We use 'hydra' as a command line interface for these experiments, you'll find the corresponding configurations (including some variations on the algorithms and environments) in the 'configs' directory.

## 1. Black-Box HPO

## 2. Heuristic Schedules

## 3. Reactive Schedules
